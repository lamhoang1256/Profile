                <h2>MY FAVORITE SUBJECT !</h2> <br>
                <span>
                    &emsp; Among many subjects student learns in school, I like math the most. 
                    This is one of the compulsory subjects from primary to high school 
                    ad even university. Math teaches learner about numbers and operation.
                    Being good at math brings us several advantages. Doing math exercise 
                    improves one’s brain and its brainstorm. Moreover, people learning 
                     math can think more logically and make up one mind. There are many
                    subjects we can apply mathematics to solve the problem: economics,
                    engineering and even business. Math is said to originate from 
                    ancient Greece and develop completely as today. In VN it’s an 
                    increasing number of mathematical genius such as Ngo Bao Chau. 
                    Therefore, Vietnamese are very proud of it. In my opinion, every 
                    student should be good at math or at least learn it. Since human 
                    gain lots of achievement related to math, specifically in modern 
                    society.

                <p> &emsp;&emsp;Do you know Chinese chess? From all the hobbies I started in my childhood
                , Chinese chess is the only hobby stayed with me without being affected
                by changes happened to me thorough my life.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;I remember how fascinated when I saw a Chinese chess Board the first time
                in my life and I urged my elder relatives to teach me how to play it.
                I remember how I was disappointed that nobody at my age then was interested
                to play Chinese Chess with me and I used to urge my elder relatives to play
                with me but they refused at first time. Because they were sure that they
                will beat me. Finally, they agreed after a lot of urging from me and I won
                but they told me that they let me win.
                Afterwards, I had a friend who like Chinese chess as much as I do, we used to
                meet daily and go to the coast with a small Chinese chess Board and play about
                3 matches a day, also we used to get Chinese chess books and apply and discuss
                the matches together.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;That is my hobby, and you? Don’t be afraid to tell me about your hobby, maybe
                     you have hobby like me.</p>
